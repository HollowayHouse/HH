      Riley Mendoza was born in a small town in Northern California in 2001. She lived in her hometown for the first 18 years of her life before moving to San Jose to study Digital Media Art at San Jose State University. Mendoza’s passion for art stems from her initial interests in storytelling and character development as a child. Her early artworks mainly include paper drawings and canvas paintings, whereas her exploration of digital mediums began when she enrolled at San Jose State University. Mendoza has experimented with a variety of forms of digital art including creative coding, digital video and photography, illustration, electronic systems and circuitry, and 3D modeling. The relationship between narratives and Mendoza’s work is evident through interactive pieces such as “Not a Y/N Fantasy” and “An MC Adventure” which are very story driven. As a student, Mendoza’s artistic experiences are more academically than professionally related. Mendoza’s works have been shown in two exhibitions at San Jose State University; one of which was the Spring 2022 NASAD Exhibition, where a group project titled “Lampable” from a course in Art as System was displayed. Mendoza is currently preparing for her BFA show to graduate from the DMA program at San Jose State University to take the next steps along her path as an artist.
